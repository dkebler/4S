a theme is put together by chosing (or not) a color theme, a typography theme, and any combination of flavors of components, pages and layouts.  Choosing is done by adding the various @import lines to a theme package file for example themes/_geek-blog.scss and then importing that in sitestyle.scss

A complete default theme is found in the base folder and thus importing a theme package will override the any or all of the base (default) theme package.
